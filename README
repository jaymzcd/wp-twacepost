Post your wordpress content automatically to your facebook wall
---------------------------------------------------------------

Recently we needed to hookup a wordpress blog to facebook. There *was* a plugin
for Wordpress that would do this but it seems to have broken recently so I've
created this from scratch to make use of the new Facebook Graph API. You'll
need to add a new application and allow that access to your chosen facebook account.

This is an early version (we're talking 0.1 here!). For now it will post to
your wall *for every update/published* post. I expect to add some sort of
checkbox to the post interface to toggle this on a per-post basis.

Requirements
------------

This plugin makes use of cURL, which is often installed and activated on even
shared hosting. As long as you can run wordpress you can probably run this. It
has been tested with Wordpress 3.0.1 but should work with the >2.7 branch also.

Installation
------------

    1. Copy the wp-twacepost folder to your wordpress plugins directory
    2. Activate the plugin
    3. Update the settings with the access_token to allow posting

Getting an access token
-----------------------

You'll need to first register a new application. We'll use this app to associate
an access token which has authorization to post to your wall. In the URL below
replace {APP_ID} with the application ID and {WP_URL} with your blog's URL.

https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/authorize?type=user_agent
    &client_id={APP_ID}&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2F{WP_URL}
    &scope=publish_stream,offline_access

By requesting "offline_access" we should only need to do this the once. If facebook
is happy it will redirect you to your blog. In the URL query string you'll
see "access_token=XXX". Copy that and update Twacepost's settings.

Now when you save/update a post it should automatically post to your wall complete
with permalink and your blog name.
